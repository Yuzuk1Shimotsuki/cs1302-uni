This is the repository for CS1302 student notebooks:

  - Registered students can run the notebooks and submit the assignments on the [JupyterHub server](https://divedeep.cs.cityu.edu.hk/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fccha23%2Fcs1302&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2F%2Fcs1302%2F&branch=main).

  - The notebooks can also be run outside the jupyterhub server using the [CS1302 Jupyter Environment](https://github.com/ccha23/cs1302jupyter).
